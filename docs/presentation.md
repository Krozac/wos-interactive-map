- Add, edit, and view buildings or points of interest.
- RESTful API for CRUD operations.
- User authentication (basic, no roles yet).
- Dockerized for easy deployment.

- **Multiple Alliances:**  
    Users can manage different alliances, such as a main alliance, farm alliance, and academy, for better organization and coordination.  
    _Note: For now, alliance management is hard-coded and not dynamically configurable._
